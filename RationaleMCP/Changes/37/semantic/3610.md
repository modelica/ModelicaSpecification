\#3610 Discrete-time variability based on GenerateEvents



Main change

Variability of functions with GenerateEvents.



Reason

Making it possible to create functions that generate events similarly as the built-in functions, and have rules consistent with them just being inlined.



Breaks

```

&nbsp; function foo

&nbsp;   input Real x;

&nbsp;   output Integer i=bar(x)+(if x>0 then 1 else 0);

&nbsp;   annotation(GenerateEvents=true);

&nbsp; end foo;



&nbsp; function bar

&nbsp;   input Real x;

&nbsp;   output Integer i=integer(x);

&nbsp;   annotation(GenerateEvents=false);

&nbsp; end bar;

&nbsp; Integer x=foo(time);

```

The call of bar in foo is now illegal, similarly as in a model.
