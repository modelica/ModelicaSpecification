# Discrete-time variability based on `GenerateEvents` #3610

## Main change

Variability of functions with `GenerateEvents`.

## Reason

Making it possible to create functions that generate events similarly to the built-in functions, and have rules consistent with them just being inlined.

## Breaks

``` modelica
function bar
  input Real x;
  output Integer i = integer(x);
  annotation(GenerateEvents=false); // Redundant, but added for clarity
end bar;

function foo
  input Real x;
  output Integer i = bar(x);
  annotation(GenerateEvents=true);
end foo;

Real x=foo(time);
```

The call of `bar` in `foo` is now illegal, similar to using `bar` directly in a model.
Note that in practice `foo` might contain both something generating event and the call to `bar`.
