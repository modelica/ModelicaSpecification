# Requirements on Base Modelica
This document should contain a first draft of the requirements on what Base Modelica should and shouldn't be, to be used as a starting point for discussions at the upcoming design meeting in Regensburg on March 7-8, 2019.  It also contains a rough separation of things belonging to the three main parts of the Modelica Language Specification (MLS) that would come out of this MCP.

## Base Modelica features

Things that the Base Modelica format should support:
- Basic scalar types with the same attributes as in Modelica.
- Record and enumeration types.
- Arrays.
- Component declarations (with both public and protected visibility).
  - Comment (@mtiller): It doesn't seem very flat if we preserve (potentially deeply nested) components instances
  - Comment (@harmanpa): This should be changed to Component declarations of the scalar types, record and enumeration types, and arrays of each; not hierarchical. Component declarations have dot-notation names.
  - Remove (that is, expand) records?
- Equations and algorithms, both scalar, array-valued, and record-valued.
- Optional source locations for use in error messages.
   - Add this to the formal grammar?  If so, this will require some thought in order to be flexible and precise enough without interfering with too much with the rest of the grammar.
   - Comment (@mtiller): Add this as standard annotations?  Already supported by current grammar.
   - Comment (@harmanpa): Agreed as that also allows other meta-data. Unfortunately having `annotation(__something_LineNumber=12)` on every statement could become quite verbose.
- Documentation strings.
- Vendor-specific annotations.
  - Comment (@mtiller): So annotations are present in the grammar but all annotations except vendor annotations are stripped.  If the concern is bloat from annotations that are no longer relevant in the lowered form (*e.g.,* graphical annotations), why not identify what gets excluded vs. what gets included? (see comment about source locations above)
  - Comment (@harmanpa): I agree, I'd like to be able to put arbitary meta-data in.
- All variabilities, but constant evaluation of parameters is not allowed.  (For example, this guarantees that all parameters will remain parameters if a Base Modelica model is exported to an FMU for Model Exchange.)
  - Comment (@mtiller): The semantics of this are unclear.  When you say constant evaluation, do you mean constant folding?  What about `final` parameters?  Should those be parameters in an FMU? I wouldn't think so.  It seems like they should just be `output`s.
- List of all `parameter` variables that were treated as `constant` due to use in _parameter expressions_, the `Evaluate=true` annotation, or subject to constant evaluation during lowering for other reasons.
  - `final` can probably be replaced by using normal equation instead of binding equation. meaning that binding eqations can always be treated as non-final.
  - Comment (@mtiller): Why not just add an `Evaluate=true` annotation to indicate these.
- Values for all constants, even those that have been inlined everywhere, since the values should be part of the simulation result.
- Less restricted forms of record field access and array subscripting?
  - Comment (@mtiller): Wouldn't we expect to restrict forms of record field access and array subscripting?  If so, then I would suggest saying "Restrict some forms of record field access and array subscripting" or "A more restrictive subset of record field access and array subscripting".
 - Comment (@mtiller): Factor out constant subexpressions to unique variables?  Perhaps filter all literals (scalars and arrays) completely out of the lowered form and provide them in a separate file?
  - Needs Standardized naming for introduced intermediate variables.
- Expressions for all variables that were treated as aliases during lowering, specifying the variable that it is an alias of and the sign of the relationship
  - Comment (@mtiller): Doesn't the expression already tell us all that (*e.g.,* `b = -a`...`-a` is an expression and it tells us that `b` is an alias of `a` with the opposite sign?  Or did you want something more explicit?  Should there be a special form of equation (perhaps in the form of an assignment statement) that can be used to indicate solved equations in general, and alias relations in particular?
  - Comment (@harmanpa): Yes syntactically it is just that expression, however that isn't necessarily the expression that the alias came from. e.g. the model might contain `a = c` and `a = -b` but we decide to keep `b`, so in our aliases section we store `b = -a` and `b = -c`.
- Function declarations that are utilised in the model.
  - Comment (@mtiller): Do we lower the functions?  I say that because functions can use features like `extends` or `redeclare` in their definitions.  Presumably we want all that removed in a lowered form, no?  Functions should probably be allowed to have arguments of array and record type.
  - Comment (@harmanpa): Yes. Additionally we might have multiple versions of functions, because we might call a function with different dimension inputs. We need a naming convention for this.

Examples of things that should be gone after lowering and shouldn't exist in Base Modelica:
- Complex classes that may contain equations.
- Connectors.
- Conditional components.
- Un-balanced `if`-equations.
- Non-literal array dimensions (except in functions).
- Packages.
- Connect equations.
- Graphical and documentation annotations.
- All redeclarations
- Anything overloaded
- Imports
- Extends clauses?
- Hierarchical modifications?
- Package structure?
  - If you keep components, restrict class definitions to a flat global namespace to avoid having to apply lookup rules.

## New organization of MLS
This MCP proposes separation of the MLS into the three parts outlined below.

### Shared features: Expressions and functions
Content of that should go into this section:
- Built-in functions.
- Expressions.
- External functions.
- User-defined functions.
- Restricted forms of record field access and array subscripting (some or all of the restrictions may be lifted for Base Modelica).
- Unit expressions.
- Syntax for synchronous language elements and state machines.

### Base Modelica
Content of that should go into this section:
- Overview of execution model for hybrid differential-algebraic equations.
- Simulation initialization and priority of non-fixed start attributes.
- Event generation, event iteration, and other discrete-time behavior.
- Semantics of synchronous language elements and state machines.
- Solving of mixed systems.
- Hints for inlining, state selection, etc.

### Modelica
Content of that should go into this section, describing lowering of (full) Modelica to Base Modelica:
- All sorts of restricted classes and rules for how they may be used.
- Inheritance, modification, and redeclaration.
- Connectors, including stream connectors.
- Connect equations.
- Overloaded operators.
- Global and local balancing of equations and variables.
- Instantiation.
- Flattening.

## An alternative view of grouping Modelica semantics (@mtiller)

One advantage to this approach would be to organize the semantics of Modelica by when they apply.  In this sense, I'd like to see a description of:

- Semantics needed in order to create a Modelica editor
  - Package structure
  - Name lookup
  - Graphical appearance
  - Connection semantics
  - Inheritance
- Semantics needed to represent mathematical structure and behavior
  - Variables
  - Equations
  - Functions

From this perspective, expressions can almost be treated as "pass through".  The editor doesn't really need to
interpret them in any way. For the most part they just pass through to the lowered form (but with some
potential simplifications or restrictions, as described above).

## Comments from regensburg design meeting (added by @HansOlsson)

Need to support start-value priority (source location or special built-in operator,
either complete source location or just needed hiearachy level).
Do after Linköping meeting?
Need to design grammar: Sub-set of current Modelica or some additions?

One major issue is variable declaration as we have e.g. `a[1].b` as a variable,
and also need record variables.
One possibility would be quoted identifiers - but can clash.
  Can we always quote a quoted one without ambiguity? Just use anything - even base64.
Another possibility is extended grammar - but looks ambiguous.
E.g. `a[1].b` could be either a variable, or access to member of array of records.

For declarations we need to know if array dimensions are part of variable or not.

Might need accessing record elements using `.` and `[` for non record variables,
  e.g., `f(x)[1]` and `f(x).x[1]`

Array of components. Repeated equations (using quoted identifiers to be clear here):
  `'a[1].x'='a[1].y';`
  `'a[2].x'='a[2].y';`
But should be possible to preserve as array equations in some way (see new frontend for OM)?

Need to test-implement? Current Flat-Modelica in e.g. Dymola is different:
e.g., records are not done like this (record values are missing), functions are missing.

Pull-requests:
- Variable naming
- Source location?
- Handling modifier level for start-attribute, e.g.: Real p(start=modifierLevel(3, 5)); or extension

Some minor comments.
