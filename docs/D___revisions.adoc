== Modelica Revision History
:id: modelica-revision-history

This appendix describes the history of the Modelica Language Design, and its contributors.
This appendix is just present for historical reasons and is not normative.
The current version, as well as all previous versions of this document, and the list of changes are available at https://specification.modelica.org.

The members of the Modelica Association project _Modelica Language_ (MAP-Lang) contributed to the Modelica specification.

Keeping just the start to have a historic perspective:

Modelica 1, the first version of Modelica, was released in September 1997, and had the language specification as a short appendix to the rationale.
