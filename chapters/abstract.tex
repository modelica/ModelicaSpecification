This document defines the Modelica\footnote{Modelica is a registered
  trademark of the Modelica Association} language, version 3.4, which is
developed by the Modelica Association, a non-profit organization with
seat in Linköping, Sweden. Modelica is a freely available,
object-oriented language for modeling of large, complex, and
heterogeneous systems. It is suited for multi-domain modeling, for
example, mechatronic models in robotics, automotive and aerospace
applications involving mechanical, electrical, hydraulic control and
state machine subsystems, process oriented applications and generation
and distribution of electric power. Models in Modelica are
mathematically described by differential, algebraic and discrete
equations. No particular variable needs to be solved for manually. A
Modelica tool will have enough information to decide that automatically.
Modelica is designed such that available, specialized algorithms can be
utilized to enable efficient handling of large models having more than
one hundred thousand equations. Modelica is suited and used for
hardware-in-the-loop simulations and for embedded control systems. More
