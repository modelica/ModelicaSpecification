\chapter{The Modelica Standard Library}\label{the-modelica-standard-library}

In order that a modeler can quickly build up system models, it is
important that libraries of the most commonly used components are
available, ready to use, and sharable between applications. For this
reason, the Modelica Association develops and maintains a growing
\emph{Modelica Standard Library} called \lstinline!package Modelica!. For an
overview of the current version see
\url{https://github.com/modelica/ModelicaStandardLibrary}.
This is a free library that can be used without essential restrictions, e.g., in
commercial Modelica simulation environments. The Modelica Standard
Library is tool-neutral, and relies on a small library,
ModelicaServices, that each conformant tool must implement to handle
tool-specific couplings, e.g., for animation. Furthermore, other people
and organizations are developing free and commercial Modelica libraries.
For information about these libraries and for downloading the free
libraries see \url{https://modelica.org/libraries/}.
