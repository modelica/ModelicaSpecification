\chapter{Scoping, Name Lookup, and Flattening}\doublelabel{scoping-name-lookup-and-flattening}

This chapter describes the scope rules, and most of the name lookup and
flattening of Modelica.

\section{Flattening Context}\doublelabel{flattening-context}

Flattening is made in a context which consists of a modification
environment (\autoref{modification-environment}) and an ordered set of enclosing classes.

\section{Enclosing Classes}\doublelabel{enclosing-classes}

The classes lexically enclosing an element form an ordered set of
enclosing classes. A class defined inside another class definition (the
enclosing class) precedes its enclosing class definition in this set.

Enclosing all class definitions is an unnamed enclosing class that
contains all top-level class definitions, and not-yet read classes
defined externally as described in \autoref{mapping-package-class-structures-to-a-hierarchical-file-system}. The order of
top-level class definitions in the unnamed enclosing class is undefined.

During flattening, the enclosing class of an element being flattened is
a partially flattened class. {[}\emph{For example, this means that a
declaration can refer to a name inherited through an extends-clause.}{]}

{[}\emph{Example}:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=modelica]
class C1 ... end C1;
class C2 ... end C2;
class C3
  Real x=3;
  C1 y;
  class C4
    Real z;
  end C4;
end C3;
\end{lstlisting}

\emph{The unnamed enclosing class of class definition C3 contains C1,
C2, and C3 in arbitrary order. When flattening class definition C3, the
set of enclosing classes of the declaration of x is the partially
flattened class C3 followed by the unnamed enclosing class with C1, C2,
and C3. The set of enclosing classes of z is C4, C3 and the unnamed
enclosing class in that order.}{]}

\section{Static Name Lookup}\doublelabel{static-name-lookup}

Names are looked up at class flattening to find names of base classes,
component types, etc. Implicitly defined names of record constructor
functions and enumeration type conversion functions are ignored during
type name lookup {[}\emph{since a record and the implicitly created
record constructor function, see \autoref{record-constructor-functions}, , and an
enumeration type and the implicitly created conversion function
(\autoref{type-conversion-of-integer-to-enumeration-values}), have the same name}{]}. Names of record
classes and enumeration types are ignored during function name lookup.

\subsection{Simple Name Lookup}\doublelabel{simple-name-lookup}

When an element, equation, or section is flattened, any simple name
  {[}not composed using dot notation{]} is looked up sequentially in each
member of the ordered set \textbf{of instance scopes (see
\autoref{the-class-tree}) corresponding to lexically enclosing classes} until a
match is found or an enclosing class is encapsulated. In the latter case
the lookup stops except for the predefined types, functions and
operators defined in this specification.

Reference to variables successfully looked up in an enclosing class is
only allowed for variables declared as constant. The values of modifiers
are thus resolved in the \textbf{instance} scope of which the modifier
appears; if the use is in a modifier on a short class definition,

This lookup in each \textbf{instance} scope is performed as follows

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Among declared named elements (\lstinline!class-definition! and
  \lstinline!component-declaration!) of the class (including elements inherited from
  base-classes).
\item
  Among the import names of qualified import statements in the
  \textbf{instance} scope. The import name of \lstinline!import A.B.C!; is \lstinline!C! and the
  import name of \lstinline!import D=A.B.C;! is \lstinline!D!.
\item
  Among the public members of packages imported via unqualified
  import-statements in the \textbf{instance} scope. It is an error if
  this step produces matches from several unqualified imports.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Import statements defined in inherited classes are ignored for
the lookup, i.e. import statements are not inherited.}

\subsection{Composite Name Lookup}\doublelabel{composite-name-lookup}

For a composite name of the form \lstinline!A.B! or \lstinline!A.B.C!, etc. lookup is performed
as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The first identifier (\lstinline!A!) is looked up as defined above.
\item
  If the first identifier denotes a component, the rest of the name
  (e.g., \lstinline!B! or \lstinline!B.C!) is looked up among the declared named component
  elements of the component.
\item
  If not found, and if the first identifier denotes a scalar component,
  or component[j] where component is an array of components and the
  indices j can be evaluated at translation time and component[j] is
  a scalar; and if the composite name is used as a function call, the
  lookup is also performed among the declared named class elements of
  the scalar component, and must find a non-operator function. All
  identifiers of the rest of the name (e.g., B and B.C) must be
  classes.
\item
  If the identifier denotes a class, that class is temporarily flattened
  (as if instantiating a component without modifiers of this class, see
  \autoref{modification-environment}) and using the enclosing classes of the denoted class.
  The rest of the name (e.g., \lstinline!B! or \lstinline!B.C!) is looked up among the
  declared named elements of the temporary flattened class. If the class
  does not satisfy the requirements for a package, the lookup is
  restricted to encapsulated elements only. The class we look inside may
  not be partial in a simulation model.
\end{itemize}

{[}\emph{The temporary class flattening performed for composite names
follow the same rules as class flattening of the base class in an
extends-clause, local classes and the type in a component clause, except
that the environment is empty. See also} \lstinline!MoistAir2! \emph{example in
\autoref{redeclaration} for further explanations regarding looking inside
partial packages.}{]}

\subsection{Global Name Lookup}\doublelabel{global-name-lookup}

For a name starting with dot, e.g.: \lstinline!.A! {[}\emph{or} \lstinline!.A.B!\emph{,}
\lstinline!.A.B.C!
\emph{etc}.{]} lookup is performed as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The first identifier [A] is looked up in the global scope. This is
  possible even if the class is encapsulated and import statements are
  not used for this. If there does not exist a class A in global scope
  this is an error.
\item
  If the name is simple then the class A is the result of lookup.
\item
  If the name is a composite name then the class A is temporarily
  flattened with an empty environment (i.e. no modifiers, see
  \autoref{modification-environment}) and using the enclosing classes of the denoted class. The rest
  of the name [e.g., \lstinline!B! or \lstinline!B.C!] is looked up among the declared named
  elements of the temporary flattened class. If the class does not
  satisfy the requirements for a package, the lookup is restricted to
  encapsulated elements only. The class we look inside may not be
  partial.
\end{itemize}

{[}\emph{The package-restriction ensures that global name lookup of
component references can only find global constants.}{]}

\subsection{Lookup of Imported Names}\doublelabel{lookup-of-imported-names1}

See \autoref{lookup-of-imported-names}.

\section{Instance Hierarchy Name Lookup of Inner Declarations}\doublelabel{instance-hierarchy-name-lookup-of-inner-declarations}

An element declared with the prefix \lstinline!outer! references an element instance
with the same name but using the prefix \lstinline!inner! which is nearest in the
enclosing instance hierarchy of the \lstinline!outer! element declaration.

Outer component declarations may not have modifications {[}\emph{including binding equations}{]}.
Outer class declarations should be defined using short-class
definitions without modifications. However, see also \autoref{simultaneous-inner-outer-declarations}.

An \lstinline!outer! element reference in a simulation model requires that one
corresponding \lstinline!inner! element declaration exist or can be created in a
unique way:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  If there are two (or more) \lstinline!outer! declarations with the same name, both
  lacking matching \lstinline!inner! declarations, and the \lstinline!outer! declarations are
  not of the same class it is in error.
\item
  If there is one (or more) \lstinline!outer! declarations of a partial class it is
  an error.
\item
  In other cases, i.e. if a unique non-partial class is used for all
  \lstinline!outer! declarations of the same name lacking a matching inner
  declaration, then an \lstinline!inner! declaration of that class is automatically
  added at the top of the model and diagnostics is given.
\item
  The annotations defined in \autoref{annotations-for-the-graphical-user-interface} does not affect this process,
  other than that:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    missingInnerMessage can be used for the diagnostic (and possibly
    error messages)
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

An \lstinline!outer! element component may be of a partial class {[}\emph{but the
referenced} \lstinline!inner! \emph{component must be of a non-partial class}{]}.
{[}\lstinline!inner!\emph{/}\lstinline!outer! \emph{components may be used to model simple
fields, where some physical quantities, such as gravity vector,
environment temperature or environment pressure, are accessible from all
components in a specific model hierarchy. Inner components are
accessible throughout the model, if they are not ``shadowed'' by a
corresponding} \lstinline!inner! \emph{declaration in a more deeply nested level of
the model hierarchy.}{]}

{[}\emph{Simple Example}:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=modelica]
class A
  outer Real T0;
  ...
end A;
class B
  inner Real T0=1;
  A a1, a2; // B.T0, B.a1.T0 and B.a2.T0 will have the same value
  A a3(T0=4); // Illegal as T0 is an outer variable.
  ...
end B;
\end{lstlisting}
More complicated example:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=modelica]
class A
  outer Real TI;
  class B
    Real TI;
    class C
      Real TI;
      class D
        outer Real TI; //
      end D;
      D d;
    end C;
    C c;
  end B;
  B b;
end A;

class E
  inner Real TI;
  class F
    inner Real TI;
    class G
      Real TI;
      class H
        A a;
      end H;
      H h;
    end G;
    G g;
  end F;
  F f;
end E;

class I
  inner Real TI;
  E e;
  // e.f.g.h.a.TI, e.f.g.h.a.b.c.d.TI, and e.f.TI is the same variable
  // But e.f.TI, e.TI and TI are different variables
  A a; // a.TI, a.b.c.d.TI, and TI is the same variable
end I;
\end{lstlisting}
{]}

The \lstinline!inner! component shall be a subtype of the corresponding \lstinline!outer!
component. {[}\emph{If the two types are not identical, the type of the}
\lstinline!inner! \emph{component defines the instance and the} \lstinline!outer!
\emph{component references just part of the} \lstinline!inner! \emph{component}{]}.

{[}\emph{Example}:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=modelica]
class A
  inner Real TI;
  class B
    outer Integer TI; // error, since A.TI is no subtype of A.B.TI
  end B;
end A;
\end{lstlisting}

{]}

\subsection{Example of Field Functions using Inner/Outer}\doublelabel{example-of-field-functions-using-inner-outer}

{[}\emph{Inner declarations can be used to define field functions, such
as position dependent gravity fields, e.g.:}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=modelica]
partial function A
  input Real u;
  output Real y;
end A;

function B // B is a subtype of A
  extends A;
algorithm
  ...
end B;

class D
  outer function fc = A;
  ...
equation
  y = fc(u);
end D;

class C
  inner function fc = B; // define function to be actually used
  D d; // The equation is now treated as y = B(u)
end C;
\end{lstlisting}
{]}

\section{Simultaneous Inner/Outer Declarations}\doublelabel{simultaneous-inner-outer-declarations}

An element declared with both the prefixes \lstinline!inner! and \lstinline!outer! conceptually
introduces two declarations with the same name: one that follows the
above rules for \lstinline!inner! and another that follows the rules for \lstinline!outer!.
{[}\emph{Local references for elements with both the prefix} \lstinline!inner!
\emph{and} \lstinline!outer! \emph{references the} \lstinline!outer! \emph{element. That in turn
references the corresponding element in an enclosing scope with the
prefix} \lstinline!inner!\emph{.}{]}

Modifications of elements declared with both the prefixes \lstinline!inner! and \lstinline!outer!
may have modfications, those modifications are only applied to the
\lstinline!inner! declaration.

{[}\emph{Example}:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=modelica]
class A
  outer parameter Real p=2; // error, since modification
end A;
\end{lstlisting}

\emph{Intent of the following example: Propagate} enabled \emph{through
the hierarchy, and also be able to disable subsystems locally.}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=modelica]
model ConditionalIntegrator "Simple differential equation if isEnabled"
  outer Boolean isEnabled;
  Real x(start=1);
equation
  der(x)=if isEnabled then -x else 0;
end ConditionalIntegrator;

model SubSystem "subsystem that 'enable' its conditional integrators"
  Boolean enableMe = time<=1;
  // Set inner isEnabled to outer isEnabled and enableMe
  inner outer Boolean isEnabled = isEnabled and enableMe;
  ConditionalIntegrator conditionalIntegrator;
  ConditionalIntegrator conditionalIntegrator2;
end SubSystem;

model System
  SubSystem subSystem;
  inner Boolean isEnabled = time>=0.5;
  // subSystem.conditionalIntegrator.isEnabled will be
  // 'isEnabled and subSystem.enableMe'
end System;
\end{lstlisting}
{]}

\section{Flattening Process}\doublelabel{flattening-process}

In order to guarantee that elements can be used before they are declared
and that elements do not depend on the order of their declaration
(\autoref{declaration-order-and-usage-before-declaration}) in the enclosing class, the flattening proceeds in the
following two major steps:

\begin{enumerate}
\item
  Instantiation process
\item
  Generation of the flat equation system
\end{enumerate}

The result is an equation system of all equations/algorithms, initial
equations/algorithms and instances of referenced functions.
Modifications of constants, parameters and variables are included in the
form of equations.

The constants, parameters and variables are defined by globally unique
identifiers and all references are resolved to the identifier of the
referenced variable. No other transformations are performed.

\subsection{Instantiation}\doublelabel{instantiation}

The instantiation is performed in two steps. First a class tree is
created and then from that an instance tree for a particular model is
built up. This forms the basis for derivation of the flat equation
system.

An implementation may delay and/or omit building parts of these trees,
which means that the different steps can be interleaved. If an error
occurs in a part of the tree that is not used for the model to be
instantiated the corresponding diagnostics can be omitted (or be given).
However, errors that should only be reported in a simulation model must
be omitted there, since they are not part of the simulation model.

\subsubsection{The Class Tree}\doublelabel{the-class-tree}

All necessary libraries including the model which is to be instantiated
are loaded from e.g. file system and form a so called \textbf{class
tree}\emph{.} This tree represents the syntactic information from the
class definitions. It contains also all modifications at their original
locations in syntactic form. \emph{{[}The class tree is built up
directly during parsing of the Modelica texts. For each class a local
tree is created which is then merged into the one big tree, according to
the location of the class in the class hierarchy. This tree can be seen
as the abstract syntax tree (AST) of the loaded libraries.{]}.} The
builtin classes are put into the unnamed root of the class tree.

\subsubsection{The Instance Tree}\doublelabel{the-instance-tree}

The output of the instantiation process is an \textbf{instance tree}.
The instance tree consists of nodes representing the elements of a class
definition from the class tree. For a component the subtree of a
particular node is created using the information from the class of the
component clause and a new modification environment as result of merging
the current modification environment with the modifications from the
current element declaration (see \autoref{merging-of-modifications}).

The instance tree has the following properties:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  It contains the instantiated elements of the class definitions, with
  redeclarations taken into account and merged modifications applied.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Each instance knows its source class definition from the class tree
  and its modification environment.
\item
  Each modification knows its instance scope.
\end{itemize}

The instance tree is used for lookup during instantiation. To be
prepared for that, it has to be based on the structure of the class tree
with respect to the class definitions. The builtin classes are
instantiated and put in the unnamed root prior to the instantiation of
the user classes, to be able to find them.

\emph{{[}The existence of the two separate trees (instance tree and
class tree) is conceptual. Whether they really exist or are merged into
only one tree or the needed information is held completely differently
is an implementation detail. It is also a matter of implementation to
have only these classes instantiated which are needed to instantiate the
class of interest.{]} }

A node in the instance tree is the instance scope for the modifiers and
elements syntactically defined in the class it is instantiated from. The
instance scope is the starting point for name lookup. \emph{{[}If the
name is not found the lookup is continued in the instance scope
corresponding to the lexically enclosing class. Extends clauses are
treated as unnamed nodes in the instance tree -- when searching for an
element in an instance scope the search also recursively examines the
elements of the extends clauses.} \emph{Except that inherited
import-statements are ignored.{]}}

\subsubsection{The Instantiation Procedure.}\doublelabel{the-instantiation-procedure}

The instantiation is a recursive procedure with the following inputs:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  the class to be instantiated (current class)
\item
  the modification environment with all applicable redeclarations and
  merged modifications (initially empty)
\item
  a reference to the node of the instance tree, which the new instance
  should go into (parent instance)
\end{itemize}

The instantiation starts with the class to be instantiated, an empty
modification environment, and an unnamed root node as parent node.

During instantiation all lookup is performed using the instance tree,
starting from the instance scope of the current element. References in
modifications and equations are resolved later (during generation of
flat equation system) using the same lookup.

\subsubsection{Steps of Instantiation}\doublelabel{steps-of-instantiation}

\paragraph*{The element itself}\doublelabel{the-element-itself}

A partially instantiated class or component is an element that is ready
to be instantiated; a partially instantiated element (i.e. class or
component) is comprised of a reference to the original element (from the
class tree) and the modifiers for that element (including a possible
redeclaration).

The possible redeclaration of the element itself takes effect.

The class of a partially instantiated component is found in the instance
tree (using the redeclaration if any), modifiers merged to that class
forming a new partially instantiated class that is instantiated as
below.

\paragraph*{The local contents of the element}\doublelabel{the-local-contents-of-the-element}

For local classes and components in the current class, instance nodes
are created and inserted into the current instance. Modifiers (including
class redeclarations) are merged and associated with the instance and
the element is partially instantiated. \emph{{[}The partially
instantiated elements are used later for lookup during the generation of
the flat equation system and are instantiated fully, if necessary, using
the stored modification environment.{]}}

Equations, algorithms, and annotations of the class and the component
declaration are copied to the instance without merging. \emph{{[}The
annotations can be relevant for simulations, e.g. annotations for code
generation (\autoref{annotations-for-code-generation}.),
simulation experiments (\autoref{annotations-for-simulation-experiments})
or functions(\autoref{declaring-derivatives-of-functions},\autoref{declaring-inverses-of-functions} and \autoref{external-function-interface}).{]}}

Extends clauses are not looked up, but empty extends clause nodes are
created and inserted into the current instance -- to be able to preserve
the declaration order of components.

\paragraph*{The inherited contents of the element}\doublelabel{the-inherited-contents-of-the-element}

Classes of extends clauses of the current class are looked up in the
instance tree, modifiers (including redeclarations) are merged, the
contents of these classes are partially instantiated using the new
modification environment, and are inserted into an extends clause node,
which is an unnamed node in the current instance that only contains the
inherited contents from that base-class.

The classes of extends-clauses are looked up before and after handling
extends-clauses; and it is an error if those lookups generate different
results.

At the end, the current instance is checked whether their children
(including children of extends-clauses) with the same name are identical
and only the first one of them is kept. \emph{{[}This is important for
function arguments where the order matters.{]}} It is an error if they
are not identical.

\paragraph*{Recursive instantiation of components}\doublelabel{recursive-instantiation-of-components}

Components (local and inherited) are recursively instantiated.

\emph{{[}}

\emph{As an example consider: }
\begin{lstlisting}[language=modelica]
model M
  model B
    A a;
    replaceable model A = C;
    type E = Boolean;
  end B;
  B b(redeclare model A = D (p=1));
  partial model C
    E e;
  end C;

  model D
    extends C;
    parameter E p;
    type E = Integer;
  end D;

  type E = Real;
end M;
\end{lstlisting}

\emph{To recursively instantiate M allowing the generation of flat
equation system we have the following steps (not including checks):}

\begin{enumerate}
\item
  \emph{Instantiate M: which partially instantiates B, b, C, D, E.}
\item
  \emph{Instantiate M.b: }

  \begin{enumerate}
  \item
    \emph{First find the class B in M (the partially instantiated
    elements have correct name allowing lookup)}
  \item
    \emph{instantiate the partially instantiated M.B with the modifier
    "redeclare model A=D(p=1)"}
  \item
    \emph{partially instantiate M.b.a (no modifier), and M.b.A (with
    modifier "=D(p=1)")}
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  \emph{Instantiate M.b.a}

  \begin{enumerate}
  \item
    \emph{First find the class A in M.b (the partially instantiated
    elements have correct name allowing lookup)}
  \item
    \emph{Instantiate the partially instantiated M.b.A with the modifier
    "=D(p=1)".}

    \begin{enumerate}
    \item
      \emph{Find the base-class "=D" from the modifier. This performs
      lookup for D in M, and finds the partially instantiated class D}
    \item
      \emph{Instantiate the base-class M.D with modifier p=1, and insert
      as unnamed node in M.b.A.}

      \begin{enumerate}
      \item
        \emph{Partially instantiate the component p with modifier "=1"}
      \item
        \emph{Find the base-class "C" in M.D. Since there is no local
        element called "C" the search is then continued in M and finds
        the partially instantiated class M.C}
      \item
        \emph{Instantiate the base-class M.C as below}
      \end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  \emph{Instantiate the base-class M.C inserting the result into unnamed
  node in M.b.a}

  \begin{enumerate}
  \item
    \emph{Partially instantiate "e"}
  \item
    \emph{Instantiate "e" which requires finding "E". First looking for
    "E" in the un-named node for extends "M.C", and, since there is no
    local element "E" the search is then continued in "M" (which
    lexically encloses M.C) and finds "E" class inheriting from Real.
    The "e" is then instantiated using class "E" inheriting from
    "Real".}
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  \emph{Instantiate M.b.a.p}

  \begin{enumerate}
  \item
    \emph{First the class "E" in M.b.a finding "E" class inheriting from
    Integer.}
  \item
    \emph{Instantiate the "M.b.a.p" using the class "E" inheriting from
    Integer with modifier "=1"}
  \item
    \emph{Instantiate the base-class Integer with modifier "=1", and
    insert as unnamed node in "M.b.a.p".}
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\emph{An implementation can use different heuristics to be more
efficient by re-using instantiated elements as long as the resulting
flat equation system is identical. }

\emph{Note that if "D" was consistently replaced by "A" in the example
above the result would be identical (but harder to read due to two
different classes called "A"). }

\emph{{]}}

\subsection{Generation of the flat equation system}\doublelabel{generation-of-the-flat-equation-system}

During this process, all references by name in conditional declarations,
modifications, dimension definitions, annotations, equations and
algorithms are resolved to the real instance to which they are referring
to, and the names are replaced by the global unique identifier of the
instance. \emph{{[}This identifier is normally constructed from the
names of the instances along a path in the instance tree (and omitting
the unnamed nodes of extends clauses), separated by dots. Either the
referenced instance belongs to the model to be simulated the path starts
at the model itself, or if not, it starts at the unnamed root of the
instance tree, e.g. in case of a constant in a package.{]}}

\emph{{[}To resolve the names, a name lookup using the instance tree is
performed, starting at the instance scope (unless the name is fully
qualified) of the modification, algorithm or equation. If it is not
found locally the search is continued at the instance of the lexically
enclosing class of the scope {[}this is normally not equal to the parent
of the current instance{]}, and then continued with their parents as
described in \autoref{static-name-lookup}. If the found component is an outer
declaration, the search is continued using the direct parents in the
instance tree (see \autoref{instance-hierarchy-name-lookup-of-inner-declarations}). If the lookup has to look into a
class which is not instantiated yet [or only partially
  instantiated], it is instantiated in place.]}

  The flat equation system consists of a list of variables with
  dimensions, flattened equations and algorithms, and a list of called
functions which are flattened separately. A flattened function consists
of algorithm or external clause and top-level variables (variables
directly declared in the function or one of its base-classes) -- which
recursively can contain other variables; the list of non-top level
variables is not needed.

The instance tree is recursively walked through as follows for elements
of the class (if necessary a partially instantiated component is first
instantiated):

\begin{itemize}
\item
  At each visited component instance, the name is inserted into the
  variables list. Then the conditional declaration expression is
  evaluated if applicable.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    The variable list is updated with the actual instance
  \item
    The variability information and all other properties from the
    declaration are attached to this variable.
  \item
    Dimension information from the declaration and all enclosing
    instances are resolved and attached to the variable to define their
    complete dimension.
  \item
    If it is of record or simple type (Boolean, Integer, enumeration,
    Real, String, Clock, ExternalObject):

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      In the modifications of \textbf{value} attribute references are
      resolved using the instance scope of the modification. An equation
      is formed from a reference to the name of the instance and the
      resolved modification value of the instance, and included into the
      equation system. Except if the value for an element of a record is
      overridden by the value for an entire record; \autoref{merging-of-modifications}.
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    If it is of simple type (Boolean, Integer, enumeration, Real,
    String, Clock, ExternalObject):

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      In the modifications of \textbf{non-value} attributes, e.g. start,
      fixed etc. references are resolved using the instance scope of the
      modification. An equation is formed from a reference to the name
      of the instance appended by a dot and the attribute name and the
      resolved modification value of the instance, and included into the
      equation system.
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    If it is of a non-simple type the instance is recursively handled.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  If there are equation or algorithm sections in the class definition of
  the instance, references are resolved using the instance scope of the
  instance and are included in the equation system. Some references --
  in particular to non simple, non record objects like connectors in
  connect statements and states in transition statements are not
  resolved yet and handled afterwards.
\item
  Instances of local classes are ignored.
\item
  The unnamed nodes corresponding to extends-clauses are recursively
  handled.
\item
  If there are function calls encountered during this process, the call
  is filled up with default arguments as defined in \autoref{positional-or-named-input-arguments-of-functions}. These are
  built from the modifications of input arguments which are resolved
  using their instance scope. The called function itself is looked up in
  the instance tree. All used functions are flattened and put into the
  list of functions.
\item
  Conditional components with false condition are removed afterwards and
  they are not part of the simulation model. \emph{{[}Thus e.g.
  parameters don't need values in them. However, type-error can be
  detected.{]}}
\item
  Each reference is checked, whether it is a valid reference, e.g. the
  referenced object belongs to or is an instance, where all existing
  conditional declaration expressions evaluate to true or it is a
  constant in a package. \emph{{[}Conditional components can be used in
  connect-statements, and if the component is conditionally disabled the
  connect-statement is removed.{]}}
\end{itemize}

This leads to a flattened equation system, except for connect and
transition statements. These have to be transformed as described in
\autoref{connectors-and-connections} and \autoref{state-machines}. This may lead to further changes in the
instance tree \emph{{[}e.g. from expandable connectors \autoref{expandable-connectors}){]}}
and additional equations in the flattened equation
system \emph{{[}e.g. connect equations (\autoref{generation-of-connection-equations}), generated
equations for state machine semantics (\autoref{semantics-summary}){]}}.

\emph{{[}After flattening, the resulting equation system is self
contained and covers all information needed to transform it to a
simulatable model, but the class and instance trees are still needed: in
the transformation process, there might be the need to instantiate
further functions, e.g. from \lstinline!derivative! annotation or from \lstinline!inverse!
annotation etc., on demand.{]}}
